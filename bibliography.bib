    abstract = {Bioinformatics approaches in data-rich domains such as Medicine and Biology have presented great opportunities for the application of Deep Learning algorithms in conjunction with biomedical data. The present paper proposes the implementation of Neural Network estimators on epidemiological data collected by the Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (HELIAD), for the multiclass classification of participants with cognitive dysfunction. The proposed workflow integrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras Feedforward Neural Networks, scikit-learn Pipelines and hyper-parameter tuning via the GridsearchCV class. We exploited these techniques in an effort to avoid data leakage, to compensate for missing values using different imputation strategies and configure dimensionality reduction with autoencoders. Additionally, Kohonen Self-Organizing Maps were implemented for unsupervised learning accomplishing sufficient clustering of the existing classes. Results show that amongst the 864 candidate models that were trained, the best estimator achieved reasonable performance in classifying participants with dementia (accuracy: 0.92), although due to the high class imbalance a lower macro-f1 score of 0.80 was more representative of the best model’ s capacity.},

    abstract = {In geriatric healthcare, missing data pose significant challenges, especially in systems used for frailty monitoring in elderly individuals. This study explores advanced imputation techniques used to enhance data quality and maintain model performance in a system designed to detect frailty insights. We introduce missing data mechanisms—Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), and Missing Not at Random (MNAR)—into a dataset collected from smart bracelets, simulating real-world conditions. Imputation methods, including Expectation–Maximization (EM), matrix completion, Bayesian networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAINs), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and GRU-D, were evaluated based on normalized Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 metrics. The results demonstrate that KNN and SVM consistently outperform other methods across all three mechanisms due to their ability to adapt to diverse patterns of missingness. Specifically, KNN and SVM excel in MAR conditions by leveraging observed data relationships to accurately infer missing values, while their robustness to randomness enables superior performance under MCAR scenarios. In MNAR contexts, KNN and SVM effectively handle unobserved dependencies by identifying underlying patterns in the data, outperforming methods like GRU-D and VAE. These findings highlight the importance of selecting imputation methods based on the characteristics of missing data mechanisms, emphasizing the versatility and reliability of KNN and SVM in healthcare applications. This study advocates for hybrid approaches in healthcare applications like the cINnAMON project, which supports elderly individuals at risk of frailty through non-intrusive home monitoring systems.},

    abstract = {The present survey examines the role of big data analytics in advancing remote sensing and geospatial analysis. The increasing volume and complexity of geospatial data are driving the adoption of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to extract meaningful insights from large, diverse datasets. These AI methods enhance the accuracy and efficiency of spatial and temporal data analysis, benefiting applications in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. Despite these advancements, challenges related to computational efficiency, data integration, and model transparency remain. This paper also discusses emerging trends and highlights the potential of hybrid approaches, cloud computing, and edge processing in overcoming these challenges. The integration of AI with geospatial data is poised to significantly improve our ability to monitor and manage Earth systems, supporting more informed and sustainable decision-making.},
